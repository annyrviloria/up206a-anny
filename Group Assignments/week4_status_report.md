# Status Update (30 Oct 2020)

#### Title: [Exploring global health indicators and trends and sub-national patterns](https://github.com/annyrviloria/up206a-anny/tree/main/Group%20Assignments)

*  **Status update:**  My initial proposal was focused on exploring health and social indicators globally to identify interesting patterns and dig deeper from there. From Yoh's and Bo's feedback I have been able to start formulating the end goal of this exploration as I agree my global lens is useful yet too broad. After playing around with the two global datasets I found I have identified the variables I am most intersted in and I have also decided to drop the education variables that I'd initially planned to explore, meaning, I'll be looking at health indicators only. After creating rankings for the indicators analyzed, I will identify one or two countries in the top-10 rankings to explore their sub-national indicators. The question I seek to answer is whether the disparities I am observing at the international level look any different when looking at sub-national data over time. This second phase will depend on the availability of sub-national data but I already have a sense of a what data repositories from the WHO and the World Bank might be available.

*  **Data update:** Although I was happy with the two data sources I had identified and used for the purposes of my data exploration, I ran into the issue of not knowing how to merge them given they used different codes to identify countries. Yoh gave me a hand with that, so I am on track to continue exploring and playing with my data.

*  **Concerns:** I  brought my primary concern, the data merge issue, to Yoh during office hours and he's alrady helped me move forward. The second concern I had was the need to narrow down my topic which I think I have a plan for thanks to the feedback received on my proposal. One last concern is related to the fact that next week's election is going to disrupt life and since I am working by myself, I don't have an 'accountability buddy' to keep me on track. To make sure I stay on top of my work I've already mapped out some milestones for myself over the next few weeks, which include continued regular visits to office hours.
