# Reaction:
At first the readings felt a bit outside of my comfort zone, but I quickly realized I had a "connection" to the topic - I did social network mapping as a research assistant for an urban anthropology project many years ago. In that setting, similar terms were used to deescribe networks: density, connectivity, and clustering, for example. With regards with the OSMnx tool described in one of the articles, I found it incredibly powerful and innovative. Because it is my first time creating a map or needing to identify data sources with spacial components to it, I could not have imagined the trouble spatial research/citizen scientists would typically go through when engaged in the mapping process. One aspect I appreciated about the design of this package is that it is useful in global south geographies, areas where I know data are more likely to be scarce. As for the second article on the evolution of street network planning and desing, I had no idea that street design was linked to car use or transportion practices. It makes a lot of sense, but I have to admit that I have never spent much time thinking about the configuration of urban spaces, or even come to the realization that urban spaces are *alive*, shifting form over time and in a sybmiotic relationship with us. However, part of the reason for this thinking has to do with the fact that street-networks **are** semi-permanent because it taked decades for them to be re-designed. Thus the need to push city planners to incorporate the crucial lessons from human- and environment- centered street designed put forward so brilliantly by the author.

# Questions for Geoff:
*   I don't have any questions about the articles but I'm curious to learn more about Open Street Maps - I get the concept, but I'm more curious about what the geographic information / mapping scene was like before Open Street Maps. Why did it come about? Was it becuase grographical data was limited? I suppose I've taken for granted the availability of maps for much of my life.
