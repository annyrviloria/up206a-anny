# 2020 UCLA+USC Mapathon

The Mapathon was a blast, probably the most stimualing event of the COVID time warp we're living through. I was able to listen to the recordings of the opening remarks by James Walker and Rachel Levine. Both of their talks spoke to my own interests in humanitarian work, and I specially appreciated the social/political context James shared when talking about the Ebola crises. From Rachel's talk I took away a sense of possibility, as she described the many applications of mapping (and particularly community-participatory mapping) for development, disaster relief, and even human rights. I'm curious about the work that the Red Cross will continue to do in this regard with the new technologies (ie. drones) that will become more and more prevalent. I then jumped into mapping, and completed 126 buildings in the South Sudan (#9365) and Kenya (#9677) projects; I ended up in 34th place, so maybe I can aim to be in place 24th next year and eventually get one of the prizes! Lastly, Ben's talk was incredibly insightful. I am more curious about digital story-telling and I take to heart the advise he gave to continue learning coding. Overall I am impressed by the fantastic work the event organizers and participants are doing individually, but even more excited to explore and generate collaboration across disciplines.
