# The New Imperative: Spatializing Health Research and Practice
## by Doug Richardson

For this week's assignment, I chose [this blog post](https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/arcnews/the-new-imperative-spatializing-health-research-and-practice/) published in the ESRI website in Fall 2018. The article provides an overview of the evergrowing role of geospatial data in health research. Examples include the modeling of environmental hazards, or the tracking of cancer clusters. Nonetheless, the author argues that there is much terrain left to explore, especially as we think about the possibilities offered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded GSPs; opening up a window into richer individual-level geodata. At the end of the article Richardson highlights the imporance of interdisciplinary collaboration, and reminds us that the stakes are high -- using the prescient example of potential pandemics that we might see in our lifetime, and the role of health and geography experts in preventing it. 

This article spoke to me because it highlights the possibilities of spatial health research. I am intrigued by the idea that spatial data and spatial analysis can generate extraordinary discoveries but I wonder whether these are discoveries of intellectual value only, or discoveries readily applicable to the policy world. For example, the author comments that we could dig deeper into individual-level geodata when answering health-related questions. I suspect that individual-level data will certainly give us a level of precision we don't often see in population-level studies, but I can't picture just yet how actionable these lessons will be. Regardless, I am fascinated by the idea that interdisciplinary collaboration can enable us in the public health field to design and advocate for more targeted, precise, and effective solutions to urgent problems.
