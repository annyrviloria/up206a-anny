# The New Imperative: Spatializing Health Research and Practice
## by Doug Richardson

For this week's assignment, I chose [this blog post](https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/arcnews/the-new-imperative-spatializing-health-research-and-practice/) published in the ESRI website in Fall 2018. The article provides an overview of the evergrowing role of geospatial data for health research. Examples include the modeling of environmental hazards, or the tracking of cancer clusters. Nonetheless, the author argues that there is much terrain left to explore, especially as we think about the possibilities that the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded GSPs, opening up the possbility to have rich individual-level geodata. At the end of the article Richardson highlights the imporance of interdisciplinary collaboration, and reminds us that the stakes are high -- using the prescient example of potential pandemics that we might see in our lifetime.

This article spoke to me because it highlights the possibilities of spatial health research. I am intrigued by the idea what integrating geodata into our data analysis might look like.
