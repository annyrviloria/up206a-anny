Hello! I am Anny, a second year Master of Public Health student at UCLA. I am anthropologist-by-training, and my professional career has focused on program implementation for international development and global health. I see health equity as a human rights issue and I am driven by the belief that to improve health we must first improve the environments we live and work in.


This quarter I am jumping outside of my comfort zone by taking [Dr. Yoh Kawano's](https://idre.ucla.edu/people/yoh-kawano) course *Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science*. In his own words:
>The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced.


By the end of the quarter, I hope to:
* Understand how spacial data science tools can be used to advance global health research
* Become comfortable using Python
* Ceate a few maps and other relevant visualuzations 
* Connect with like-minded classmates!


**Final project ideas:**  :memo: 
* Anything global health related but specially interested in: water access, vaccination, labor conditions, informal settlements, transportation infrastructure.
* If focused on a more 'local' issue: housing segretation and health, homelessness, and food security.
